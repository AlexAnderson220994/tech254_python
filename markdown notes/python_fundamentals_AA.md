# Python Fundamentals
## Data Types
### Operators

Operators are symbols that execute a particular mathematical or logical function. <br>

Examples of Arithmetic operators are: <br>

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulo (%) - returns the remainder of a division

Numeric types include:

- Integers (whole numbers)
- Floats (floating numbers/decimals)
- Complex

#### Strings

Strings are lines of text encased in either double or single quotation marks. <br>

````
"Hello World!"
'Hello World!'
````
Double quotation marks are preferred so they don't get confused with single quotation marks if quotes or apostrophes are needed.

## Variables
 A variable labels data within a program and stores it for later use.
## Booleans

A Boolean value is a *binary* option between either *True* or *False* values.

````
False = 0
True = Any value that isn't 0
````

## Collections

Collections are capable of storing multiple pieces of data with them. <br>

There are 4 built-in data types in python used to store collections of data.

- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionary


### Lists

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. List items are ordered, changeable and allow duplex values. <br>

````
list_one = ["football", "tennis", "hockey"]
````

### Tuples

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable).

````
tuple_one = ("football", "tennis", "hockey")
````

### Sets

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.

````
set_one = {"football", "tennis", "hockey"}
````

### Dictionary

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates.

````
dict_one = {
   "sport": "football",
   "player": "Messi",
   "club": "Miami",
}
````
