# **Python Libraries & Modules**

## Libraries

A library is a collection of code that makes code based tasks easier. Python has an extensive library of tools for manipulating, visualising, and training machine learning methods.
<br>

Everything in the library needs to be imported to make it accessible. e.g.

- `import math`
- `import random`

## Modules

A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes and variables. It can also include runnable code.

## Important in-built libraries and modules

- `collections` - This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.
- `datetime` - Classes for manipulating dates and times.
- `logging` - Defines functions and classes which implement a flexible event logging system for applications and libraries.
- `math` - Provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.
- `numpy` - NumPy is used for working with arrays (lists).
- `os` - Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
- `pip` - Package manager for modules
- `sys` - Provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment
- `time` - Provides ways of representing time in code.
